<p style="font-size:16px;">I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Williams College where I teach Intermediate Microeconomics and Game Theory. My research is primarily in experimental economics and game theory when I look at how different designs affect the evolution of behavior in populations. I completed my PhD at the University of Oregon in 2023 and am on the job market for the 2024-2025 cycle. </p>

Testing the Efficacy of Stepping Stone Equilibria in
Coordination Games
</a></strong></p>

<p style="font-size:16px;">
Games with multiple equilibria introduce the potential for populations to get stuck in inefficient outcomes. In theory, the introduction of additional equilibria, "stepping stones", could pave the way for a smoother and less risky transition. I run a lab experiment to test if the introduction of these “stepping stones”, can facilitate transitions from an inefficient but safe equilibrium to a risky, payoff dominant equilibrium. I employ different payoffs for the transition strategy and examine the effects that different degrees of information about the game have on group's play. I find evidence that adding these "stepping stones" does help populations transition to the efficient equilibria. I also find that when groups have more information about each other's payoffs they are able to transition to the efficient equilibria faster and are less prone to cyclical behavior.</p><img src="https://ethanholdahl.com/assets/images/SteppingStoneData.png" alt="Stepping Stones Games" style="width:70%;">
