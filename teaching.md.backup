<p style="font-size:16px; margin:0"><em>"This class wasn't what I expected (my fault) and I switched it to pass/fail pretty early on, which wasn't great for my motivation to do
well. I'm an Econ minor but I really don't like Econ. However, Ethan formatted the course so that I really had no choice but to stay engaged on some level. As hard as I tried to really get through this class without learning anything, I actually learned a decent bit about game theory. Not sure if a bigger compliment can be given to a teacher than that. I hope Ethan gets the opportunity to continue teaching courses."</em></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16px; margin:0"><em>"Ethan clearly cares about his students and really wants them to learn the course material. He was very helpful in office hours and made this class a really great experience."</em></p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16px; margin:0"><em>"I really appreciated this econ class. I was intimidated to take it at first, but it was the only one that fit in my schedule. I have really struggled in all my other economics courses, but this is the first one where I understand a good portion of the material and feel comfortable doing the work in the class."</em></p>

<p style="font-size:16px; margin:0"><em>"Ethan Holdahl has done a phenomenal job both relaying course materials and information to us as well as creating systems and resources for us to access and learn with outside of the classroom. Ethan has been incredibly approachable all term and has put our learning as his students first in all circumstances, building time into class to verify that we understood course content, dedicating personal time and weekends to creating supplemental resources, applying in class strategies to ensure content retention, and so much more. Despite the question asking for us to avoid comments about our instructor, I feel like Ethan's hard work and dedication deserves to be recognized."</em></p>

<p style="font-size:16px; margin:0"><em>"Mr. Holdahl has given everyone in the class lots of support, and continues to constantly go out of his way to make sure that everyone is able to understand and learn the best possible. I have had a lot of moments of confusion, and he is very patient and understanding, and will help until I fully understand a concept!"</em></p>
